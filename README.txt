It is a good practice to create own branches to work / research on our own, so that we can have documented code / tracking even for our own junk code + research. 
At the end, if we think our functionality should be added (merge) to the main project, thats where the 'master' branch comes in, that contains the main project files and no experimentation / testing is done on the master.

However, It is OK if all of you want to work on the develop branch only (instead of all separate branches) and are able to add changes without disrupting the implementation in the dev branch.


Master: contains the final code / changes which should not be touched and only fetched as required upon new install.
Develop: The main development branch where every one develops / puts final changes that they have researched in their own respective branches beforehand. Error solutions and discussions can be done in this branch.

Structure:

Individual branches 	-> 	develop branch			->	Master
(rough code etc) 		(put final functionality 		('uber' final branch where final code is 					that you think is suitable)		pushed for the project. Not to be `											messed with :D)
